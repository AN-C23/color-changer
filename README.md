# Color Changer Project
Today you will be completing exercises listed in `level-one.js`, `level-two.js` and `level-three.js`.

When you think you have completed the project correctly, open `check-my-work.html` and preview the file in Cloud9.
`check-my-work.html` validates your code and will point out errors if it finds them.
If the tests are all green then your project is correct!

## Set-Up Your Project
First, we need to check out the project.

* On this page, click **Fork** in the top right to get your own copy
* Then open up Cloud9. Go to Respositories, find **color-changer** and click **Clone to edit**.
* Name the Workspace as **color-changer**, leave all other settings as default and click **Create workspace**.

## Create the HTML
Open `index.html` in your project workspace, and add the JQUERY library to the head of your html: 
```<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.js"></script>```

Now in the body of your HTML:
* Add a button with the id "change" and the text "Change Color".
* Add a text input field with the id "newColor".
* Add a second button with the id "add" and the text "Add Color".

## Javascript Part One
Open `solution.js` in your project workspace
